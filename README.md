# lek

**lek** is a tool for quickly switching work contexts, inspired by the `workon` command from Python's virtualenvwrapper.

`lek myproject`

* creates a new workspace in your desktop environment (Linux Mint only at present)
* switches to that workspace
* opens a new browser window, and in it, a list of browser tabs as specified in your ~/.Lekfile
* opens your terminal emulator at a specific directory(ies)
* Opens your text editor with a specific project folders 
* executes any other commands you need (eg `docker run <container>`, `vagrant up`, etc)

## Roadmap
* There will be a roadmap. That, for now, is the roadmap.

## Contributing
* You can contribute.

## Why 'lek'?
It's named 'lek' because I wanted a very short command and that word popped into my head. In my home county of Yorkshire (and some of  the North East), 'lekking' means 'playing out with your friends' when you're a kid. It's probably a Viking word. In modern Swedish ['lek' means 'to play'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lek). Also, the 'lek' namespace was available on GitHub, and isn't an existing Unix/Linux command.
